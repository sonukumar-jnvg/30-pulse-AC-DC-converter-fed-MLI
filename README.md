The multi-pulse converter and multi-level inverter are becoming game changing power converters for the medium voltage drive applications, due to the shown excellent power quality profile. Design and control a 30-pulse AC-DC converter and 7-level cascaded voltage source inverter(7-CMLI) to improve the power quality profile at the supply end and drive end of the medium voltage induction motor drive (MVIMD), respectively.
